# ðŸ’§ Rainlang ðŸ’§

Rainlang is an onchain smart contract language for any EVM, designed to be easier to be much easier to read and write.

Rainlang is:
- parsed onchain (by a smart contract)
- interpreted onchain (by a smart contract)
- permissionlessly extensible (add your own words to the language)
- immutable (none of the contracts are upgradable or have admin keys)

# Raindex
Raindex is a new kind of DEX, where all of the orders are smart contracts written in Rainlang. Think perpetual, algorithmic strategies.
